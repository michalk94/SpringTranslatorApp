# SpringTranslatorApp
Very simple application for translation created in Spring boot. For more information go to README.


Like the description and title says, very simple app for translating. I created this app for practicing
Dependency Injection and basically it's the only technique used in this project for now. I think of maintaining this project
just for fun and adding another options. Im thinking of adding relational databases(hibernate) in the future and making it 
a web app. For now it's all. Not a lot to say about technologies.
- Spring Boot
-Dependency Injection
(for now)

Stay tuned!
