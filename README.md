# SpringTranslatorApp
Very simple application for translation created in Spring boot. For more information go to README.



  Like the description and title says, very simple app for translating. I created this app for practicing. I think of maintaining this project just for fun and adding another options. The idea was to create simple java application and 
transform it into webapp, adding new technologies like Spring MVC REST Hibernate and basically everything that i will want to practice. Let's call it my exercise field! So don't judge it for now!!  
  For now it's all. Not a lot to say about technologies.
- Spring Boot
-Dependency Injection
(for now)

Stay tuned!
